	    	<p>Nikola Tesla is a dreamer, inventor, scientist, and electrical engineer. He spoke eight languages and has a photographic memory. He holds to his name more than 275 patents.</p>

	    	<p>Nikola was born during a lightning storm on July 10, 1856 in Smiljian, Croatia. He died at 86 years old on January 7, 1943, in New York City, USA.</p>

	    	<p>He created the first induction motor that ran on AC (Alternating Current), widely used to this day to provide electricity to our houses.  It is indeed one of the most important inventions in history.  Tesla first dreamed of this motor in Budapest back in 1882, and he was able to make it in 1887. He said,</p>

	    	<blockquote cite="https://www.zmescience.com/science/history-science/history-induction-motor/">“At that age, I knew entire books by heart, word for word. One of these was Goethe’s ‘Faust’. The sun was just setting and reminded me of the glorious passage, ‘Sie ruckt und weicht, der Tag ist uberlebt, Dort eilt sie hin und fordert neues Leben. Oh, da kein Flugel mich vom Boden hebt Ihr nach und immer nach zu streben! Ein schöner Traum indessen sie entweicht, Ach, au des Geistes Flügeln wird so leicht Kein körperlicher Flügel sich gesellen!’ As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash of lightening and in an instant the truth was revealed. I drew with a stick on the sand, the diagram shown six years later in my address before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and my companion understood them perfectly.<br/>
	    	<br/>
	    	"The images I saw were wonderfully sharp and clear and had the solidity of metal and stone, so much so that I told him, ‘See my motor here; watch me reverse it.’ I cannot begin to describe my emotions. Pygmalion seeing his statue come to life could not have been more deeply moved. A thousand secrets of nature which I might have stumbled upon accidentally, I would have given for that one which I had wrested from her against all odds and at the peril of my existence…”</blockquote>

			<p>The first hydro-electric powerplant in the Niagara Falls, USA, was designed by none other than Nikola Tesla.  He also invented the Tesla coil, which we still use today in radio technology.</p>	

			<p><i>Inventions: Three-phase electric power, Induction motor, Tesla valve, Violet ray, Wireless telegraphy, Vacuum variable capacitor, Alternating current, Neon lamp, Remote control, Tesla coil.</i></p>

			<p>When he died, the Office of Alien property in the US seized all of his belongings from his hotel room, so the rest of his inventions are classified. People say that Nikola lived a hundred years ahead of his time. True enough, he had the idea of wireless technology back in 1901. He said,</p>

			<blockquote> "The day will soon come when I will show the world that the transmission of power and speech without the aid of any wires is possible." </blockquote>
